## Overview
This repository contains a cloud-native FinTech application designed to deliver secure, efficient, and scalable financial services. The application is based on a microservices architecture and includes predictive models for loan approval and insurance management. It also provides separate frontend applications for admin and client dashboards.

## Architecture

### 1. **Microservices**

### Conception:

The system is built using Spring Boot microservices, each serving a specific purpose:

- **User Microservice**: Manages user accounts, profiles, and authentication data.
- **Transaction Microservice**: Handles financial transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Authentication Microservice**: Manages user authentication using OAuth2/JWT for secure access.
- **Account Microservice**: Manages user accounts, balances, and account details.
- **Notifications Microservice**: Sends email notifications for critical events, such as account creation or loan approvals.
- **Loan Management Microservice**: Handles loan applications, approvals, and repayment schedules.
- **Insurance Management Microservice**: Manages policies for car and health insurance.

Each microservice is deployed in a containerized environment using Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes (AWS EKS).



### 2. **Predictive Models**
We have implemented three predictive models using Flask to serve machine learning APIs:

- **Loan Approval Model**: Predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on user-provided data.
- **Car Insurance Model**: Assesses the risk and calculates premiums for car insurance policies.
- **Health Insurance Model**: Evaluates health insurance applications and estimates premiums.

### 3. **Frontend Applications**
- **Admin Dashboard**: A web-based application for administrators to manage users, transactions, loans, and insurance policies.
- **Client Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for clients to interact with the platform, view accounts, apply for loans, and manage insurance policies.

Both applications are built using React and are fully responsive.

## Deployment

### 1. **Containerization**
All components, including microservices and Flask models, are containerized using Docker for consistency and portability.

### 2. **Orchestration**
Kubernetes (AWS EKS) is used to manage and scale containers across multiple nodes. Each service has its own deployment and service configuration in Kubernetes.

### 3. **Cloud Infrastructure**
The application is hosted on AWS with the following resources:
- **Compute**: EC2 instances managed by EKS.
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL) for relational data.
- **Storage**: S3 for storing documents and other static assets.
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch and Prometheus for real-time monitoring and alerting.
